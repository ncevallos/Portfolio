  <img src="images/natasha.JPG" width="200" height="250" id="imageFloat" alt="image of Natasha"> I was originally born in Orlando, FL, but graduated from high school in Naples, FL. I received my Bachelor’s degree from Florida Gulf Coast University in Fort Myers, FL. After completing my Bachelor's degree I decided that I wanted to learn more about coding, and creating apllications, and web programs, so I enrolled in University of Central Florida’s Coding Bootcamp, in Fort Lauderdale. My aspiration is to do someday do something where I make an impact in our world. Whether that impact comes about through creating a new App, or website that changes or improves the way something is already done, or being lucky enough to come up with a new exciting idea that innovates something altogether.</p>
<p>My work history highlights, include previously working for the Apple Store, being a dispatch supervisor for UPS, and managing a high-volume restaurant in Naples. While working for the Apple Store, my job description was an Inventory Specialist. During my time there, I contributed to our team being ranked as one of the top 5 stores in the world, for our inventory accuracy.</p>
  <p>Before working for Apple, I worked for UPS. One of the highlights of my UPS career was that I was able to be a part of the implementation team, that took the UPS Fort Myers building from an analog loading and dispatch system, to a completely digital version. My experience during that time taught me a lot about how computer systems and programs work, and the limitations that one can encounter in the real world, when it comes to digitizing an analog system.</p>
  <p>My most recent job experience was working as a Culinary Professional at Seasons 52, while completing my Bachelor’s at FGCU. The most notable experience I gained from this job, I feel, is that it was a very valuable experience in crafting who I am today. I learned a lot about managing, and working with different types of people, and personality traits, and how to craft together and create a team. I also learned a lot about time management, as well as being able to further hone in my skills as a planner, as we would sometimes feed well over a thousand guests on holidays.</p>
  <p>My true interest at heart though, is in tech. Where I hope to gain, and use my abilities to create something that lasts more than the 10-20 minutes it takes someone to eat a meal. Growing up I always had an interest in technology, and web design, which is why I enrolled in the Coding Boot Camp, and am seeking out opportunities in a new and exciting field.
